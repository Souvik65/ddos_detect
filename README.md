# DDOS_Detect

#
Welcome to the DDoS Detection Tool, your comprehensive solution for safeguarding network infrastructure against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS attacks, which aim to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target with a flood of Internet traffic, can cause significant downtime and damage. Our tool is engineered to provide robust, real-time detection and mitigation of these attacks, ensuring your services remain operational and secure.

This tool combines sophisticated algorithms and state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to continuously analyze network traffic, identify anomalous patterns indicative of DDoS activity, and respond promptly to neutralize threats. It is designed with scalability in mind, making it suitable for networks of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises.
